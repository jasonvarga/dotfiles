Never perform git commits without asking.

Delete files or directories using `rm` without any options. It is aliased to `trash`.

Don't always assume I know what I'm talking about. If I ask you to do something, and it goes against best practices, warn me about it.

Make sure newly created files have a trailing newline.

Avoid adding docblocks unless specifically asked.

Avoid self-explanatory comments. For example:
```
// Do something
this.doSomething()
```
